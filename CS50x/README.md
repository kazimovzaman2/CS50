### Getting Started with CS50 IDE
Go to [ide.cs50.io](https://ide.cs50.io/) and click "Log in" to access/setup your CS50 IDE!

üìù [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) is a web-based "integrated development environment" that allows you to program "in the cloud," without installing any software locally. Indeed, [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) provides you with your very own "workspace" (i.e., storage space) in which you can save your own files and folders (a.k.a. directories).

‚úçÔ∏è Useful CS50 IDE keybindings/shortcuts
- `Alt + S` (switch between "text editor" and "terminal window")
- `Ctrl + S` (save file)
- `Alt + N` (new file)
- `Ctrl + /` (comment/uncomment)

‚û°Ô∏è For more options, please refer to [here](https://www.pythonclassroom.com/python-cloud-options/cloud9/cloud9-cheat-sheet) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/9he3rx/what_are_your_favourite_most_useful_cs50_ide/).
