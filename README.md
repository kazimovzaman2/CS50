# CS50 Repository

A collection of labs, problem sets and code files for "CS50's Introduction to Computer Science", HarvardX, October-December, 2021.

> Note on academic honesty:
If you're taking CS50W, either through [Harvard Extension School](https://extension.harvard.edu/), [Harvard Summer School](https://summer.harvard.edu/) or [OpenCourseWare](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/), please do not blindly copy paste my code. You are putting yourself at a huge risk for getting excluded from the course by the staff themselves as they grade each project thoroughly. This is a course offered by Harvard, and you will be put up to their standard.
